# brainfuck in Elm
Got stuck on parsing for a while now I'm maybe going to finish it because I figured out how parsers work but there are probably improvements to be made along the way

## To do
* Web UX
* Increase performance such that it can be used for non trivial programs  
eg, it can't even do helloworld right now, that's just too much mang
